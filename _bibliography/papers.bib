The iodine interstitial has been established as a deep level defect and implicated as an active recombination center. We analyze the quantum mechanics of carrier trapping. Fast and irreversible electron capture by the neutral iodine interstitial is found. The effective Huang–Rhys factor exceeds 300, indicative of the strong electron–phonon coupling that is possible in soft semiconductors. The accepting phonon mode has a frequency of 53 cm–1 and has an associated electron capture coefficient of 1 × 10–10 cm3 s–1. The inverse participation ratio is used to quantify the localization of phonon modes associated with the transition. We infer that suppression of octahedral rotations is an important factor to enhance defect tolerance.},

	abstract = {Hot-carrier cooling (HCC) in metal halide perovskites above the Mott transition is significantly slower than in conventional semiconductors. This effect is commonly attributed to a hot-phonon bottleneck, but the influence of the lattice properties on the HCC behavior is poorly understood. Using pressure-dependent transient absorption spectroscopy, we find that at an excitation density below the Mott transition, pressure does not affect the HCC. On the contrary, above the Mott transition, HCC in methylammonium lead iodide is around 2–3 times faster at 0.3 GPa than at ambient pressure. Our electron–phonon coupling calculations reveal ∼2-fold stronger electron–phonon coupling for the inorganic cage mode at 0.3 GPa. However, our experiments reveal that pressure promotes faster HCC only above the Mott transition. Altogether, these findings suggest a change in the nature of excited carriers above the Mott transition threshold, providing insights into the electronic behavior of devices operating at such high charge-carrier densities.},

    abstract = {Exchanging hydrophobic alkyl-based side chains to hydrophilic glycol-based side chains is a widely adopted method for improving mixed-transport device performance, despite the impact on solid state packing and polymer-electrolyte interactions being poorly understood. Presented here is a Molecular Dynamics (MD) force field for modelling alkoxylated and glycolated polythiophenes. The force field is validated against known packing motifs for their monomer crystals. MD simulations, coupled with X-ray Diffraction (XRD), show that alkoxylated polythiophenes will pack with a `tilted stack' and straight interdigitating side chains, whilst their glycolated counterpart will pack with a `deflected stack' and an s-bend side chain configuration. MD simulations reveal water penetration pathways into the alkoxylated and glycolated crystals - through the \{{\textbackslash}pi\}-stack and through the lamellar stack respectively. Finally, the two distinct ways tri-ethylene glycol polymers can bind to cations are revealed, showing the formation of a meta-stable single bound state, or an energetically deep double bound state, both with a strong side chain length dependance. The minimum energy pathways for the formation of the chelates are identified, showing the physical process through which cations can bind to one or two side chains of a glycolated polythiophene, with consequences for ion transport in bithiophene semiconductors.},

We show that the FHIP mobility theory is capable of demonstrating non-Drude transport behaviour, and provides good agreement with the recent diagrammatic Monte-Carlo mobility simulations of Mishchenko et al. {\textbackslash}cite\{Mishchenko2019\} for the abstract Fr{\textbackslash}"ohlich Hamiltonian. We extend this method to multiple variational parameters in the model action, and to multiple phonon modes in the true action. This enables a slightly better variational solution, as inferred from the resulting energy. We carry forward this complexity into the mobility theory, where it enables richer structure in the frequency and temperature dependent mobility, due to the different phonon modes activating at different energies.},

    abstract = {Hybrid halide perovskites materials have the potential for both photovoltaic and light-emitting devices. Relatively little has been reported on the kinetics of charge relaxation upon intense excitation. In order to evaluate the illumination power density dependence on the charge recombination mechanism, we have applied a femtosecond transient mid-IR absorption spectroscopy with strong excitation to directly measure the charge kinetics via electron absorption. The irradiance-dependent relaxation processes of the excited, photo-generated charge pairs were quantified in polycrystalline MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, and (FAPbI3)0.97(MAPbBr3)0.03 thin films that contain either methylamonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA). This report identifies the laser-generated charge species and provides the kinetics of Auger, bimolecular and excitonic decay components. The inter-band electron-hole (bimolecular) recombination was found to dominate over Auger recombination at very high pump irradiances, up to the damage threshold. The kinetic analysis further provides direct evidence for the carrier field origin of the vibrational Stark effect in a formamidinium containing perovskite material. The results suggest that radiative excitonic and bimolecular recombination in MAPbI3 at high excitation densities could support light-emitting applications.},
