By absorbing two lower energy photons (red), combining the energy and emitting these as a higher energy photon, you can increase the efficiency of a solar cell device. This also means that you can make use of higher bandgap semiconductors for your solar cell. There are a lot of earth abundant materials that can make a high bandgap solar cell (such as inorganic nitrides and oxides, and organic homopolymers), and these materials tend to be highly stable.</p> <p>However there is a long way to go until we have a working technology! A key issue is that one needs to maintain the excited state for a long enough time that it has a chance of meeting another excited state. As a dye molecule in direct sunshine absorbs about one photon a second, and the excited state typically decays away in less than a nanosecond (one billionth of a second), there is a very large chasm to bridge.</p> <p>Hanbo’s initial project is joint computational and experimental, looking at some new organic polymers synthesised in the <a href="https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/hab60" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hugo Bronstein group</a>.

His MSci project (2005–2006) was under Prof. Geoff New on modelling ‘fractal light’ as generating in a highly magnifying laser cavity with a polygonal aperture; a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dJPs1nPTjM" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">youtube video</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOYN9YmXaHo" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hi-Def, but without annotation</a>, working(ish) <a href="https://github.com/jarvist/FractalLight" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">code</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0612027" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MSci report</a> are available. His PhD (2007–2012) was supervised by Prof. Jenny Nelson FRS and Prof. Donal Bradley FRS CBE, and supported by BP Solar and an EPSRC DTP award.</p> <p>Jarv got into research on photovoltaics for the environmental reason of trying to avert climate change. This is not because he particularly cares about polar bears or coral reefs, but because he likes a world in which the climate is stable enough to grow enough food to eat. He is deeply cynical about how useful any of his research actually is, and is quite generally fearful that much renewable energy research is effectively a form of greenwashing, allowing society to further procrastinate from making the necessary changes and investment in the hope of some future scientific-technological ‘deus ex machina’ to allow us to continue leading our energy profligate lives without trashing the planet. However, as he is even worse at, and more cynical of, politics, he continues to apply himself to this long-odds technological bet.</p> <p>Jarv is a strong proponent of open-science, open-source, and open-access.</p> <p>Outside academics Jarvist mainly looks after T1 (born Nov 2018) and T2 (born Nov 2020).. He still goes cycling occasionally, and used to spend a lot of his time <a href="https://www.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/caving/old/archive.php" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">caving</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/MqqWyQF0gAg?t=636" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">diving</a> and sailing.

Well, it’s become increasingly apparent that polar scattering dominates (and therefore limits) charge-carrier mobility in multicomponent semiconductors. These semiconductors are increasingly important for technical application. The path-integral approach provides a fully quantum-mechanic solution to this scattering (within certain provisos, natch!). With it you have a fully predictive model of charge-carrier mobility, with no empirical parameters.</p> <p>Twitter: <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Neutrino155" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@Neutrino155</a></p> <div style="clear: both"></div> <p>Brad’s 3-minute video summary from September 2021: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kITVNewwaZw" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/kITVNewwaZw/0.jpg" alt="Brad's 3-minute video summary in September 2021."></a></p> <p>Brad is funded by an EPSRC Doctoral Training Award.</p> <div style="clear: both"></div> <h2 id="jack-coker-phd-march-2020">Jack Coker (PhD March 2020–)</h2> <p>Jack’s project is in pushing the development of charge-carrier simulations in the hopping regime.
