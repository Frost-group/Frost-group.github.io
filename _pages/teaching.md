## In development...

### Physical machine learning

Before the fairly specific Python + PyTorch based delivery of content for the
ML MRes described below, I was developing some more general scientific machine
learning materials with Julia + Pluto notebooks.

## Computational solid state physics

Based in the solid-state physics computational teaching I've undertaken on
various MRes and CDTs, I'm starting to put together a general introductory
course to bridge the gap between undergraduate solid state physics / chemistry,
and then a research student level of running electronic structure calculations.

## 2021--2022

### Machine Learning and Big Data (MRes, Physics, Imperial)

In the 'practical' sessions I taught by a mix of lecturing and Jupyter
notebooks, with an introduction to neural networks (including building a single
neuron classifier by hand), and then a more intermediate introduction to Graph
neural networks, and Ordinary Differential Equations nets. 

My project was on trying to infer parameters for chaotic ODEs.

### Solution processible electronics (MRes, Physics, Imperial)

For this I taught a lectured component on solid-state theory & electronic structure.
(Very high level overview!)

A key concept was relating effective mass to band structures, the 2020 (Zoom,
pre-recorded) derivations of which are available on YouTube:

I also ran a computational workshop using ASE and GPAW within Jupyter notebooks

<https://github.com/Frost-group/2021-SEM-MRes-MaterialStructureAndDynamics-ComputationalWorkshop>

The aim of this workshop is to get some experience of running solid-state
(periodic) electronic structure calculations. You should adapt the notebooks,
which Jarvist wrote to calculate for CsPbI3 cubic-perovskite material, to your
own semiconductor from the active learning component of the lectures. As you
achieve calculations in the lab, copy and paste the results into the collective
document as a record of what you've done.

We are using ASE (the Atomic Simulation Environment) in a Jupyter notebook. ASE
is a python package which allows computational manipulation and calculation of
solid-state structures. It can use multiple back-ends for doing the actual
calculations.

In this lab we will be using the GPAW which is based in projector-augmented
wave (PAW) density functional theory on a real-space grid.

### Girls who Machine Learn (GirlsWhoML)

I delivered a guest lecturer (over Zoom) for Girls Who Machine Learn
(GirlsWhoML), organised by Imperial's Women in Physics and Women in Computing
society, and attended voluntarily by students from across the Imperial
faculties. 

I mainly used the provided materials, but added some of the content on the
single neuron classifier from the above MRes. I also added a couple of
Mentimeter based quizzes for active learning. I can't share the materials as
I don't own sole copyright, but I certainly recommend volunteering if you have
the opportunity - it was very interesting and useful to try and deliver content
to a different cohort.
