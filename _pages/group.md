## Jarvist Moore Frost (PhD Imperial 2012)

![Photo of Jarvist wearing a red jumper.](/assets/img/JarvistMooreFrost_Feb2017_SonyA1_RedJumper_Square_250px.jpg)

Jarvist approached computational physics back to front, in that after being introduced to LOGO in the reception class of his primary school on a creaky old BBC Micro, he learnt a lot of his higher physics by reference to how it could be expressed on a computer. His MSci project (2005--2006) was under Prof. Geoff New on modelling 'fractal light' as generating in a highly magnifying laser cavity with a polygonal aperture; a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dJPs1nPTjM) [Hi-Def, but without annotation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOYN9YmXaHo), working(ish) [code](https://github.com/jarvist/FractalLight) and [MSci report](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0612027) are available. 
His PhD (2007--2012) was supervised by Prof. Jenny Nelson FRS and Prof. Donal Bradley FRS CBE, and supported by BP Solar and an EPSRC DTP award. 

Jarv got into research on photovoltaics for the environmental reason of trying to avert climate change. This is not because he particularly cares about polar bears or coral reefs, but because he likes a world in which the climate is stable enough to grow enough food to eat. 
He is deeply cynical about how useful any of his research actually is, and is quite generally fearful that much renewable energy research is effectively a form of greenwashing, allowing society to further procrastinate from making the necessary changes and investment in the hope of some future scientific-technological 'deus ex machina' to allow us to continue leading our energy profligate lives without trashing the planet. 
However, as he is even worse at, and more cynical of, politics, he continues to apply himself to this long-odds technological bet. 

Jarv is a strong proponent of open-science, open-source, and open-access.

Outside academics Jarvist mainly looks after T1 (born Nov 2018) and T2 (born Nov 2020).. He still goes cycling occasionally, and used to spend a lot of his time [caving](https://www.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/caving/old/archive.php), [diving](https://youtu.be/MqqWyQF0gAg?t=636) and sailing. Jarv was hit by lightning at around 8:20 PM on 12th August 2017 and did not die.

# PhD students graduated

## Keerati 'PK' Keeratikarn (PhD April 2021--2025)

Keerati's initial project is looking at building (anharmonic) potential energy
surfaces with function approximation methods (machine learning). The intent is
to build a surrogate model with a few electronic structure calculations, and
then use this as the basis for many-body phonon perturbation-theory, enabling
much larger systems to be treated.

## Hanbo Yang (PhD Oct 2020--2025)

![Hanbo Yang, mugshot.](/assets/img/hanbo.jpg)
{:class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" style="float: left; margin: 0rem 2rem 2rem 2rem"}

Hanbo is working on molecular materials for the up-conversion of light. 
By absorbing two lower energy photons (red), combining the energy and emitting
these as a higher energy photon, you can increase the efficiency of a solar
cell device. 
This also means that you can make use of higher bandgap semiconductors for your
solar cell. There are a lot of earth abundant materials that can make a high
bandgap solar cell (such as inorganic nitrides and oxides, and organic
homopolymers), and these materials tend to be highly stable. 

However there is a long way to go until we have a working technology! 
A key issue is that one needs to maintain the excited state for a long enough
time that it has a chance of meeting another excited state. As a dye molecule
in direct sunshine absorbs about one photon a second, and the excited state
typically decays away in less than a nanosecond (one billionth of a second),
there is a very large chasm to bridge. 

Hanbo's initial project is joint computational and experimental, looking at
some new organic polymers synthesised in the [Hugo Bronstein group](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/hab60). We are attempting to both measure and model the time-resolved decay routes of the materials.

## Bradley A.A. Martin (PhD Oct 2020--)

![Bradley A.A. Martin.](/assets/img/brad_250px.jpg)
{:class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" style="float: left; margin: 0rem 2rem 2rem 2rem"}

Brad comes from a theoretical physics background. His first project is in
extending the Feynman variational path-integral approach to the polaron
problem, working on the
[PolaronMobility.jl](https://github.com/jarvist/PolaronMobility.jl) codes. 

Why should we care about polarons? Well, it's become increasingly apparent that
polar scattering dominates (and therefore limits) charge-carrier mobility in
multicomponent semiconductors. These semiconductors are increasingly important
for technical application. The path-integral approach provides a fully
quantum-mechanic solution to this scattering (within certain provisos, natch!).
With it you have a fully predictive model of charge-carrier mobility, with no
empirical parameters.

## Jack Coker (PhD March 2020--2024)

Jack's project is in pushing the development of charge-carrier simulations in the hopping regime. This is most relevant for disordered organic materials, where the charges are localised as small polarons and move (relatively slowly!) in a series of thermally activated 'hops'.

## Leonard Logaric & Tilman Roeder (BSc two-term project 2019--2020)

Leonard and Tilman built a tight-binding software that was automatically differentiable. This means that gradients could be back-propagated from the outputs of the model, all the way to the analytic form of the tight-binding model overlap integrals. 
Using this, they fitted models to synthetic data from standard density functional theory calculations on the same system. By comparison with state of the art black-box (no gradient) optimisation methods, they showed that the model was more accurate with fewer data points.
