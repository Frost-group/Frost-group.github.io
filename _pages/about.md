We are an experimental:computational:theoretical (about 20:30:30 ratio) research group based in
the Department of Chemistry at Imperial College London. 

Our aim is to combine experiment and theory to develop new functional
materials. 
Our particular focus is building *on top of* electronic structure theory, using
these standard codes to add chemical specificity to more highfalutin physical
models. 

A material class we are interested in are photovoltaics, for which we need to
understand the interaction of light and charges in semiconductors.
