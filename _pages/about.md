We are an experimental / computational / theoretical research group based in
Experimental Solid State (EXSS) in the Department of Physics at Imperial
College London. 

Our aim is to combine experiment and theory to develop new functional
materials. 
Our particular focus is building *on top of* electronic structure theory, using
these standard codes to add chemical specificity to more highfalutin physical
models. 

A material class we are interested in are photovoltaics, for which we need to
understand the interaction of light and charges in semiconductors.
