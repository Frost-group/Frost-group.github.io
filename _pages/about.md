We are an experimental/computational/theoretical research group based in
Experimental Solid State (EXSS) in the Department of Physics at Imperial
College London. 

Our aim is to combine techniques to understand and thereby develop new
functional materials. 
A particular focus is building *on top of* electronic structure theory using
these standard codes to add chemical specificity (by calculating matrix
elements of interest) to more highfalutin physical models. 

A particular material focus are photovoltaics, for which we need to understand
the interaction of light and charges in semiconductors.
